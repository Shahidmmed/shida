                Leads is a software solution designed to help businesses
                organise and manage their sales leads throughout the customer
                acquisition process. It typically includes tools for capturing,
                storing and tracking interactions with potential customers and
                analysing the data received to help sales and marketing teams
                make informed decisions. The system allows businesses to
                streamline their sales processes, increase efficiency, improve
                lead conversion rates, and ultimately boost customer relations.

                I conducted an informal moderated usability study with 6
                participants from 18th April to 28th April 2023. This test aimed
                to determine if users can complete the core tasks within the
                product efficiently and whether or not they understand the
                interface and its processes. Each session lasted approximately
                5-7 minutes. Participants were given the same tasks to complete
                and questions to answer. All participants generally found the
                product user-friendly, easy to navigate and straightforward.

                  Participants who could not be on a call completed a list of

                  to answer questions into detail after every task was performed
                  through a survey. In the end, a usability scale questionnaire
                  of 10 questions was sent to participants to complete.

                  Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. Participants were assured

                spoke when help was needed or when it was time to give a new

                Most of the feedback and recommendations received were compiled
                and grouped by severity. The data with the highest severity were
                implemented immediately because they focused more on improving
                the product's user experience and what does not work well for
                users.

                  Based on the feedback from the usability test and the SUS
                  data, it can be concluded that the Leads management system I
                  designed has a logical user flow with an overall good user
                  interface. The product was comprehensible and usable to most
                  participants, with a high conversion rate. However, some areas
                  needed improvement, particularly with the contacts and leads
                  features and some user interface components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Additionally, some users requested a more responsive prototype
                  which I will continue to work on to make this prototype and
                  future prototypes easier to use. The study also revealed that
                  users valued the categorisations of leads and the colours used
                  to differentiate items.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Overall, the leads management system has a solid foundation in
                  terms of usability, but there is room for improvement (on my
                  part) regarding the prototype's responsiveness to enhance the
                  user experience during a usability test. The feedback gathered
                  from the usability study was used to inform the current design
                  iterations and improvements to the system.
