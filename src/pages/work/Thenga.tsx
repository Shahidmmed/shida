                    Introduction

                  <p className=" py-8">
                    When I was presented with the Thenga concept, I knew
                    immediately that it was a project I would be passionate
                    about. The idea of making e-shopping accessible and simple
                    for Ghanaians was intriguing to me, even though it's not
                    something I personally engage in regularly. I was excited to
                    take on the challenge of designing a solution that would
                    work for many people. Before the redesign, the Thenga
                    product was quite hard to understand. It had many steps and
                    processes that made the product quite unpleasant to use.
                    After some discussions and brainstorming sessions, my team
                    and I developed a new Thenga flow with distinctive features
                    that maintained the goal of the product and made it way
                    better to navigate while promoting accessibility. One of my
                    favourite things about the new design is its functionality -
                    I wanted to make sure it was super simple for people to use
                    without any trouble. It was an exciting journey for me and a
                    bold step into the world of product design. I learned a lot,
                    improved my skill, and achieved things I didn't know I
                    could.

                            My task was to redesign the Thenga product, which at
                            the time, was just a website. But after strategising
                            with my team, determining what we wanted to build
                            and who it was for, we decided to split the product
                            into two parts. This stage was essential because it
                            allowed me to improve the user experience and create
                            a more streamlined process for shoppers.

                            significantly benefit many people. We explored what

                    Based on the persona insights, I mapped out the steps a

                    visualised their feelings and emotions as they completed
                    these tasks. This was done to help create an obstacle-free
                    path for users and determine any pain points or
                    opportunities. This enabled me to define further the
                    product's scope, functional requirements, and features. I
                    used cute little cloud faces to depict their emotions.

                  <p className=" pt-8">
                    As part of my design process, I focused on creating an
                    information architecture by carefully piecing together most
                    of the components of each screen to identify what users will
                    see and interact with at every step of their journey when
                    using the product. This approach provided a comprehensive
                    view of the product's experience and helped (through
                    iterations) minimise the number of screens users had to
                    navigate to achieve their goals. Below is an overview of the
                    information architecture I developed, which serves as the
                    foundation for the website's final design.

                    Based on the business and user goals, I swiftly put down all
                    my ideas and joined the site's information architecture to
                    visualise the potential of the product's interface using
                    Figma. I then developed the initial low-fi wireframes into
                    what I like to call "My First Draft," which consisted of my
                    early ideas and colour schemes. To perfect the design, I
                    reviewed the draft repeatedly, making numerous iterations
                    until I was satisfied with the final work. For the final
                    draft of Thenga, the most significant change was the colour
                    scheme. Through this iterative process, I produced a design
                    that suited the product's requirements.

                    vibrant components and illustrations, all working together
                    seamlessly to deliver an ideal interface. I wanted to drive
                    users to view information and complete tasks while
                    maintaining consistency throughout the design. I created a
                    comprehensive style guide encompassing the colour palette,
                    typography, button states, iconography, and more. This guide
                    is a reference point to ensure that the design remains
                    consistent and coherent.
